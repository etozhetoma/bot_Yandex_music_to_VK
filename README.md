# bot_Yandex_music_to_VK

This crazy bot will help you parse all your favorite music from Yandex and add it to VK :D

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary packages for python:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```
(if you don't have one, it will be automatically installed)

And just make a gitclone this repository in a convenient place. After, open it with any text editor and correct the yandex_mail and password.

## Usage

Since the script does not use VK api to add tracks, the script adds tracks manually using the "pyautogui" package.

The easiest way to run a script is if your monitor has a resolution of 1920x1080 :)
All you need to do is:

1. Place the browser as shown in the picture

2. Open VK music in the browser and run the script. Do not touch the mouse! Just watch.

If you do not have a fullhd monitor, you will need to change the coordinates in the script :(

(or buy a fullhd monitor for this program :D)
